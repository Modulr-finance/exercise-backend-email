# Email Service

Welcome to the Modulr coding exercise!

## Introduction

We have created an exercise designed to let you show off your skill and creativity when it comes to API design and implementation.

Consider an email client like Gmail or Outlook and imagine you are writing a backend service to handle the requests coming from the UI.

To keep things high level you are only required to implement the controller methods. You can assume that there is an `EmailService` that can handle any complicated logic.

We have also included a sample project using `Spring` and `Java 11` with a controller available in `EmailController`. It is not strictly required that you use `Spring` and are welcome to use whatever `REST` implementation you choose.

## Requirements

Expand on the `EmailController` to include endpoints that provide the following functionality:
* Read a single email
* Read multiple emails
* Send an email
* Delete an email

You are in complete control of how those endpoints are structured however you should consider things such as
* Appropriate HTTP Method
* Path
* Request and response

## Assessment

Your submission will be used in the next part of the interview process to discuss your approach and implementation.

## Forking / hosting your solution on a public repo

Please take sensible steps to avoid other candidates being able to view your submission.
